This directory contains scripts necessary to produce the blog archive. Specifically, it contains:
    - datelist.txt, a liquid template file 
    - taglist.txt, a liquid template file
    - _generator.rb, a ruby script 
Note that this directory does not contain any user-facing content.
    
The archive should be generated as follows:
    - first, run `bundle exec jekyll build'. This will cause the liquid templates
      datelist.txt and taglist.txt to be processed. Once processed, these files
      provide information necessary to _generator.rb in the next step.
    - run `ruby blog/archive/_generator.rb'. The generator will produce ./dates/
      and ./tags/, which collectively contain all the files which make up the
      archive. ./dates/ contains files of the form "%Y" or "%Y-%m". Each of these
      files will be moved to "blog/%Y/index.html" and "blog/%Y/%m/index.html" in
      the next step. ./tags contains directories, one for each tag, and each 
      directory contains an index.html. These will be moved to
      "blog/tags/<tag-name>/index.html" in the next step.
    - run `ruby exec jekyll serve' (for testing) or commit and push. The files
      generated by _generator.rb will be moved to their specified locations,
      resulting in the archive structure that the user sees.

Since the site is currently hosted on github pages, I automate this process before
I commit with the following pre-commit git hook:

#!/usr/bin/sh

# this line is necessary to get the script to run in magit
PATH=$PATH:~/.gem/ruby/2.3.0/bin

echo "Running jekyll pre-build..."   \
&& bundle exec jekyll build          \
&& echo "Generating archives..."     \
&& ruby blog/archive/_generator.rb   \
&& echo "Done!"
