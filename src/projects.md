## Personal Projects

My personal projects are open-source and can be found on
[github](https://github.com/dudelson/).
Right now, there is only one worth noting here:
[gobi](https://github.com/JordanGreissman/gobi).
Gobi is a turn-based strategy game inspired by Sid Meyer's Civilization V. It
was born out of a team-based final project I did for my functional programming
course [CS3110](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2016fa/).
Right now it is a terminal game, so the graphics are pretty
crude, but once I clean up the codebase I plan to port it to the web using
[ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/en/).

## Academic Projects

I also have a few academic projects, including:

- I co-authored a toy operating system with pre-emptive threading, a filesystem,
  and a nearly-complete TCP/IP stack for my undergrad course on
  [operating systems](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4410/2016sp/index.php).
- I co-authored a (very messy) python implementation of the paxos
  distributed consensus protocol for a course on
  [distributed computing](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5414/2017fa/).
- `xic` is a compiler for a simple object-oriented language which I completed
  with a team of four for Cornell's compilers course, CS4120.

For academic integrity reasons, these projects are closed-source. However, if
you would like to view the source code for any of these projects, do not
hesitate to [contact me](/contact).

## Odds and Ends

I have a separate page dedicated to
[what I'm working on now](/now).
