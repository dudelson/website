Thanks for stopping by my online home!

I am a software engineer who is passionate about building, learning, and teaching.

I believe that **the internet is the most important invention in human
history**, with far-reaching implications for the way people live every facet of
their lives. To date humanity has barely scratched the surface of the full
potential of computing -- social media, online education, and cryptocurrency are
only the beginning!

I invite you to explore the import of these technologies by checking out some of
