The first month of GSoC is already over! Time for some updates on my progress.
<!--more-->
Over the past two weeks I've gotten myself up to speed with using
[webmachine](https://github.com/inhabitedtype/ocaml-webmachine),
which required learning about OCaml
[classes](https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/classes.html)
and
[objects](https://github.com/inhabitedtype/ocaml-webmachine).
After getting these OCaml concepts under my belt, I wrote a few webmachine
examples in order to understand the standard way of interacting with the
library. At this point, I'm ready to start implementing the endpoints from my
[proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vu97h2gNuJMTEYdIcghFfo_9L4GtCpEprzWfOivhy6g/edit)
one-by-one, which I plan to start this week.
