This week in GSoC: REST APIs and their specifications!
<!--more-->
The former half of the week I was travelling for the 4th of July, but the latter
half of week I started writing the specification for the REST API. I learned
that there is basically no standard for specificying a REST API, and actually
there's quite a bit of disagreement on how this should be done. I also learned
that the endpoints of the API are supposed to be nouns, so the endpoints I
proposed in my proposal are completely off the mark. I don't have enough of the
specification complete to submit it for review yet, but I hope to accomplish
this next Monday.
