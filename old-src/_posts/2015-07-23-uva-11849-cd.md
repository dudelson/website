[UVa 11849: CD](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=24&page=show_problem&problem=2949) is 
an easy problem, as long as you use a set. <!--more--> Using a vector or array will not work. If you try to use a vector to store whether or not Jack owns each cd, you will use up too much memory, since there are 1 billion possible cds. If you try to keep a sorted vector of the cds Jack owns, you will get TL because the input size (1 million) is too large for an O(nlogn) operation. A set solves both of these problems, because it only stores the elements it needs to and does insertions and lookups in O(logn). Once we know to use a set, we can solve the problem this way: Keep all of the cds Jack owns in a set. For each cd that Jill owns, check to see if it is in the set. If so, increment the number of cds that both Jack and Jill own by 1.
