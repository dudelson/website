Notes on some blockers I encountered over my family vacation.
<!--more-->
Week 5 went by in a blur, mostly because I was at Disney World with my
family (Disney is exhausting!). Due to this I was not able to give much time to
GSoC, but I did spend a little bit of time working on the `read` endpoint for
the API. From this work I have a couple of blockers I am hoping to work through
with my mentor next week:

1. [irmin_http_server.ml l.306-309](https://github.com/mirage/irmin/blob/master/src/irmin-http/irmin_http_server.ml#L306)
   contains calls to the functions `contents_t`, `node_t`, `commit_t`, and
   `branch_t`. What is the point of these functions? It sort of seems like
   you're making one type of store out of another, but I don't understand how
   the stores are different.
2. I don't understand how it is possible to call `rd.Wm.Rd.foobar`
   (e.g.
   [here](https://github.com/mirage/irmin/blob/master/src/irmin-http/irmin_http_server.ml#L265)).
   `Wm` was defined earlier in the module, so shouldn't it be simply `Wm.Rd.foobar`?

Hopefully after I get these blockers out of the way, endpoint implementation
should come a lot easier.
