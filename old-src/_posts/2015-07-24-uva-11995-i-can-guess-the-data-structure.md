[UVa 11995: I Can Guess the Data Structure!](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/119/p11995.pdf) simplified problem statement: Given a sequence of push/pop operations, state whether the operations are valid for a queue, stack, priority queue, or some combination thereof (including none thereof).
<!--more-->
This is a straightforward simulation problem as long as you know how to use STL queues, stacks, and priority_queues. If you don't, this is a good problem to solve in order to learn how to use them!
