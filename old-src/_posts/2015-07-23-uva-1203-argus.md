[UVa 1203: Argus](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=24&page=show_problem&problem=3644) was a sort of poorly written problem, and I thought it was a lot harder than it actually turned out to be. <!--more-->
Basically, you are given a number of tasks. Each task has an id number and an interval. The interval specifies how often the task returns. You are then given a number `k`, and your program must print out the first `k` tasks to return in chronological order. This can be done efficiently using a priority queue. We insert pairs of pairs and ints ((t, id), i) into the priority queue, where t is the next time the task will return, i is the interval of the task we are inserting, and id is its id. Since the STL priority queue is a max heap, and we need a min heap, we make all of the entries in the priority queue negative, effectively making it sort in reverse order. Thus the task with the smallest positive t will be at the front of the priority queue, due to the natural sorting order of pairs. For `k` iterations, we pop a task off the front of the priority queue, print its id number, add i to t, and push our updated task back into the priority queue.
