I am a recent graduate of [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/)
with a degree in computer science. My technical interests include fullstack
development, systems programming, distributed systems, and information security.
I also like functional languages, FOSS, and fiddling with emacs.

My non-technical interests include Japanese language and culture, aikido,
cross-country skiing, and [productivity hacking](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/).
If you happen to like chiptunes as much as I do, you can check out my [fan
page](https://bandcamp.com/ubeatlenine) on bandcamp.

Currently I live in the greater Boston area, where I work as a Release Engineer
for Red Hat.
